## Overview

### The challenge

This slider component's design included a mobile and desktop view and needed a graceful way for the desktop view to scale down.

The component defaults to the mobile view and accepts _large_ boolean prop. I also added faint click sounds with the [useSound](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/use-sound) hook.

### Useful resources

- [What the heck, z-index??](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/) - This Josh Comeau helped me better understand the stacking order of HTML elements with `z-index`.
- [The styled-components Happy Path](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/styled-components/) - This Josh Comeau article convinced me to try out Styled Components. I didn't refer to it for this project but I highly recommend it.
